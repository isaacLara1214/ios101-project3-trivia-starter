## Notes

I had alot of trouble and couldnt figure out how to wrap text in a button. No matter the size I made the button it would not show the full word unless i presss on it multiple times. this limited me to single word answers.
Another issue i couldnt figure out was why after i pressed an answer it would show the default button text i set.
